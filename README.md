<h1>Password Generator</h1>
<br>
<h2>My Task</h2>
<p>This week’s homework requires you to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they’ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.</p>
<br>
<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>
<li>GIVEN I need a new, secure password</li>
<li>WHEN I click the button to generate a password</li>
<li>THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria</li>
<li>WHEN prompted for password criteria</li>
<li>THEN I select which criteria to include in the password</li>
<li>WHEN prompted for the length of the password</li>
<li>THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters</li>
<li>WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password</li>
<li>THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters</li>
<li>WHEN I answer each prompt</li>
<li>WHEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected</li>
<li>WHEN all prompts are answered</li>
<li>THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria</li>
<li>WHEN the password is generated</li>
<li>THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page</li>
